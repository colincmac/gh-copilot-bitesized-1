## DEMO 1 - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) 
In this demo, we will explore how GitHub Copilot can assist in solving LeetCode problems. We will start by signing up for a LeetCode account, then proceed to a specific problem. We will use GitHub Copilot to generate a solution, which we will then submit on LeetCode. We will also explore how to improve the performance of the solution by asking GitHub Copilot for optimization suggestions. This demo will showcase the capabilities of GitHub Copilot in providing efficient solutions and improving existing code.

### Prerequisites 
- Sign up for a leetcode account at https://leetcode.com
